Project Title:
Predicting User Movie Preferences on Netflix

Problem Statement:
Netflix wants to improve its recommendation engine by predicting whether a user will like a movie or TV show based on their viewing history, demographics, and movie/series metadata (genre, cast, ratings, release year).
Your task is to perform the end-to-end ML workflow to build a predictive model.

Steps:
1. Data Preparation
Handle missing values in user or movie data.
Encode categorical variables such as genre, cast, and director.
Normalize numerical features like movie duration, release year, and ratings.
2. Data Validation
Split dataset into training, validation, and test sets.
Ensure users in the test set also appear in the training set (to avoid cold-start leakage).
Apply stratified sampling if necessary (e.g., like vs dislike balance).
3. Feature Selection
Use correlation analysis to remove redundant features.
Apply feature importance methods (Random Forest, XGBoost).
Perform dimensionality reduction (PCA, SVD) for high-dimensional categorical data like cast/genre.
4. Feature Engineering
Create user-level features such as:
Average rating given
Favorite genre
Most watched time of day
Create movie-level features such as:
Popularity score
Average user rating
Trending flag
Generate interaction features (e.g., user × genre preferences).
5. Model Building
Train classification models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, or Neural Networks.
Optionally explore Collaborative Filtering or Matrix Factorization approaches.
Perform hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV/RandomizedSearchCV.
6. Model Testing & Evaluation
Evaluate models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC.
Compare baseline models with advanced recommendation models.
Discuss trade-offs (e.g., precision vs recall in suggesting movies to users).

Deliverables:
Preprocessed dataset with user and movie features.
At least 3 trained models with documented preprocessing pipelines.
Comparison report of performance metrics.
Final recommendation for improving Netflix’s recommendation system.

Skills Tested:
Data preprocessing (handling missing data, encoding, normalization)
Validation techniques (train-test split, cross-validation)
Feature selection & engineering
Model training (classification + recommendation models)
Model evaluation and interpretation for recommendation systems
